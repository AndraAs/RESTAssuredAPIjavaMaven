I have created a Maven project with Cucumber Rest Assured dependencies.
The test can be executed from any IDE by running it as a Junit test or Java Application from the file: TestRunner.java. This will also generate a Cucumber report link, available in the console output.
The test can also be executed as a Cucumber test from the file: validations.feature
Finally the test can be executed from command line by using: mvn test. This will only be available if Maven and Java are installed and the enviroment variables are set for both.
